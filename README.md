# LOC Counting Application

This project provides a simple utility for counting lines of code (LOC) and physical lines in source code files(PHY).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To build and run this project, you need to have the following installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Apache Maven

### Installing

Follow these steps to get a development environment running:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your/loc-counting.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```
   cd loc-counting
   ```

3. Compile the project using Maven:

   ```
   mvn compile
   ```

### Running the tests

To run the automated tests for this system:

```
mvn test
```

### Break down into end to end tests

The tests validate the accuracy of the line counting functionality on various types of source code files.

```
Example: The testCountLOC method checks if the LOC count matches the expected value.
```

### And coding style tests

Coding style tests ensure that the source code adheres to defined coding standards.

```
Example: The testCountPhysicalLines method verifies the accuracy of physical line counting.
```
